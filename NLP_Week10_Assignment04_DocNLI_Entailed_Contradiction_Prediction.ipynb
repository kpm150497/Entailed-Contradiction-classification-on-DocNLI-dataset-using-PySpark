            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away.

texas were on alert last night as hurricane bush headed west after hitting southern florida leaving at least eight dead, causing severe property damage, and leaving 1.2 million homes without electricity. gusts of up to 165 mph were recorded. it is the fiercest hurricane to hit the us in decades. as bush moved across the gulf there was concern that it might hit new orleans, which would be particularly susceptible to flooding, or smash into the concentrated offshore oil facilities. president andrew authorized federal disaster assistance for the affected areas.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |hurricane andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in us history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of new orleans. the storm, which brought havoc to southern florida on monday and then headed north-west across the gulf of mexico, had made landfall late on tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural cajun country. although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. in louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city, franklin and new iberia. associated tornadoes devastated laplace, 20 miles west of new orleans. then, however, andrew lost force as it moved north over land. by yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas. the storm caused little damage to louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. the lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. more than dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. in north miami, damage is minimal. worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across homestead, 25 miles to the south of miami, where a typical house sells for dollars 100,000 to dollars 150,000. us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but lloyd's exposure there is minimal. many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a holiday inn. across florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. hurricane hugo, which devastated much of south carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some dollars 4.2bn. further uninsured losses may have raised the total to dollars 6bn-dollars 10bn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n",

            "|us cities along the gulf of mexico from alabama to eastern texas were on storm watch last night as hurricane andrew headed west after sweeping across southern florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. the hurricane was one of the fiercest in the us in decades and the first to hit miami directly in a quarter of a century. in the bahamas, government spokesman mr jimmy curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. mr justin balcombe, of uk-based insurance adjuster balcombe group, said total losses could exceed dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. that compares with the dollars 4bn-dollars 6n (pounds 2.1bn-pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big us hurricane, hugo, which hit south carolina in 1989. the brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among us insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. mr george lloyd-roberts, chairman of lloyd's underwriters' non-marine association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded pounds 3bn, the lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, us insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through lloyd's. mr roger hill, insurance analyst at warburg securities, said he estimated that mainline uk insurers faced no more than pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'at the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. the real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the uk underwriters. royal insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than pounds 20m. among other uk insurers, mr hill estimated that general accident may face losses of up to pounds 30m, while guardian royal exchange faced pounds 5m and sun alliance and commercial union pounds 10m each. however, hurricane andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the gulf of mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards new orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the alabama port of mobile and the louisiana-texas border, probably tomorrow night or early thursday. it could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the gulf of mexico. shell oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. a substantial part of america's oil refining industry is concentrated on the gulf coast, in louisiana and texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. andrew, the first caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. it ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the gulf. a million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern florida as the hurricane moved in from the bahamas on sunday. the florida power and light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of coral gables, just south of miami, where the national hurricane center is located. its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. president bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected

            "|us cities along the gulf of mexico from alabama to eastern texas were on storm watch last night as hurricane andrew headed west after sweeping across southern florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. the hurricane was one of the fiercest in the us in decades and the first to hit miami directly in a quarter of a century. in the bahamas, government spokesman mr jimmy curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. mr justin balcombe, of uk-based insurance adjuster balcombe group, said total losses could exceed dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. that compares with the dollars 4bn-dollars 6n (pounds 2.1bn-pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big us hurricane, hugo, which hit south carolina in 1989. the brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among us insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. mr george lloyd-roberts, chairman of lloyd's underwriters' non-marine association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded pounds 3bn, the lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, us insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through lloyd's. mr roger hill, insurance analyst at warburg securities, said he estimated that mainline uk insurers faced no more than pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'at the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. the real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the uk underwriters. royal insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than pounds 20m. among other uk insurers, mr hill estimated that general accident may face losses of up to pounds 30m, while guardian royal exchange faced pounds 5m and sun alliance and commercial union pounds 10m each. however, hurricane andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the gulf of mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards new orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the alabama port of mobile and the louisiana-texas border, probably tomorrow night or early thursday. it could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the gulf of mexico. shell oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. a substantial part of america's oil refining industry is concentrated on the gulf coast, in louisiana and texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. andrew, the first caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. it ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the gulf. a million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern florida as the hurricane moved in from the bahamas on sunday. the florida power and light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of coral

            "|us cities along the gulf of mexico from alabama to eastern texas were on storm watch last night as hurricane andrew headed west after sweeping across southern florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. the hurricane was one of the fiercest in the us in decades and the first to hit miami directly in a quarter of a century. in the bahamas, government spokesman mr jimmy curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. mr justin balcombe, of uk-based insurance adjuster balcombe group, said total losses could exceed dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. that compares with the dollars 4bn-dollars 6n (pounds 2.1bn-pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big us hurricane, hugo, which hit south carolina in 1989. the brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among us insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. mr george lloyd-roberts, chairman of lloyd's underwriters' non-marine association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded pounds 3bn, the lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, us insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through lloyd's. mr roger hill, insurance analyst at warburg securities, said he estimated that mainline uk insurers faced no more than pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'at the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. the real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the uk underwriters. royal insurance estimated the company's losses at no more

            "|hurricane andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in us history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of new orleans. the storm, which brought havoc to southern florida on monday and then headed north-west across the gulf of mexico, had made landfall late on tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural cajun country. although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. in louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city, franklin and new iberia. associated tornadoes devastated laplace, 20 miles west of new orleans. then, however, andrew lost force as it moved north over land. by yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas. the storm caused little damage to louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. the lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. more than dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. in north miami, damage is minimal. worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across homestead, 25 miles to the south of miami, where a typical house sells for dollars 100,000 to dollars 150,000. us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but lloyd's exposure there is minimal. many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a holiday inn. across florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. hurricane hugo, which devastated much of south carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some dollars 4.2bn. further uninsured losses may have raised the total to dollars 6bn-dollars 10bn.

            "|hurricane andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in us history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of new orleans. the storm, which brought havoc to southern florida on monday and then headed north-west across the gulf of mexico, had made landfall late on tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural cajun country. although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. in louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city, franklin and new iberia. associated tornadoes devastated laplace, 20 miles west of new orleans. then, however, andrew lost force as it moved north over land. by yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas. the storm caused little damage to louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. the lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. more than dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. in north miami, damage is minimal. worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across homestead, 25 miles to the south of miami, where a typical house sells for dollars 100,000 to dollars 150,000. us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but lloyd's exposure there is minimal. many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a holiday inn. across florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. hurricane hugo, which devastated much of south carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some dollars 4.2bn. further uninsured losses may have raised the total to dollars 6bn-dollars 10bn.

            "|hurricane andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in us history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of new orleans. the storm, which brought havoc to southern florida on monday and then headed north-west across the gulf of mexico, had made landfall late on tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural cajun country. although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. in louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city, franklin and new iberia. associated tornadoes devastated laplace, 20 miles west of new orleans. then, however, andrew lost force as it moved north over land. by yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas. the storm caused little damage to louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. the lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. more than dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. in north miami, damage is minimal. worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across homestead, 25 miles to the south of miami, where a typical house sells for dollars 100,000 to dollars 150,000. us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but lloyd's exposure there is minimal. many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a holiday inn. across florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. hurricane hugo, which devastated much of south carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some dollars 4.2bn. further uninsured losses may have raised the total to dollars 6bn-dollars 10bn.

considerably in recent years us insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through lloyd s mr roger hill insurance analyst at warburg securities said he estimated that mainline uk insurers faced no more than pounds m in damage claims so far at the moment we are relaxed about it he said the real question he added is the level of reinsurance available to the uk underwriters royal insurance

losses there are likely to total less than dollars bn well below earlier expectations a senior member of lloyd s insurance market said yesterday in louisiana the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city franklin and new iberia associated tornadoes devastated laplace miles west of new orleans then however andrew lost force as it moved north over land by yesterday afternoon it had been down graded to tropical storm in that its sustained windspeeds were below mph initial reports said at least one person had died been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast after confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas the storm caused little damage to louisiana s important oil refining industry although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut the lloyd s member in close contact with leading insurers in florida said that damage to insured property was remarkably small more than dollars bn of damage may have been caused in all but was mostly to uninsured property he said in north miami damage is minimal worst affected is one hotel whose basement was flooded most of the destruction occurred in a mile band across homestead miles to the south of miami where a typical house sells for dollars to dollars us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties but lloyd s exposure there is minimal many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area only one big hotel in that area has been

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state. Picture, Page 14|us cities along the gulf of mexico from alabama to eastern texas were on storm watch last night as hurricane andrew headed west after sweeping across southern florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. the hurricane was one of the fiercest in the us in decades and the first to hit miami directly in a quarter of a century. in the bahamas, government spokesman mr jimmy curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. mr justin balcombe, of uk-based insurance adjuster balcombe group, said total losses could exceed dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. that compares with the dollars 4bn-dollars 6n (pounds 2.1bn-pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big us hurricane, hugo, which hit south carolina in 1989. the brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among us insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. mr george lloyd-roberts, chairman of lloyd's underwriters' non-marine association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded pounds 3bn, the lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, us insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through lloyd's. mr roger hill, insurance analyst at warburg securities, said he estimated that mainline uk insurers faced no more than pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'at the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. the real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the uk underwriters. royal insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than pounds 20m. among other uk insurers, mr hill estimated that general accident may face losses of up to pounds 30m, while guardian royal exchange faced pounds 5m and sun alliance and commercial union pounds 10m each. however, hurricane andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the gulf of mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards new orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the alabama port of mobile and the louisiana-texas border, probably tomorrow

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away.

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.

'at the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. the real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the uk underwriters. royal insurance estimated the company's losses at no more

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands.

Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's.

'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m.

            "|US CITIES along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on storm watch last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after sweeping across southern Florida, causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage. The hurricane was one of the fiercest in the US in decades and the first to hit Miami directly in a quarter of a century. In the Bahamas, government spokesman Mr Jimmy Curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands. Mr Justin Balcombe, of UK-based insurance adjuster Balcombe Group, said total losses could exceed Dollars 15bn if business interruption claims were taken into account. That compares with the Dollars 4bn-Dollars 6n (Pounds 2.1bn-Pounds 3.1bn) of insurance industry losses caused by the last big US hurricane, Hugo, which hit South Carolina in 1989. The brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among US insurers, industry analysts said yesterday. Mr George Lloyd-Roberts, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriters' Non-Marine Association, said that, unless damage claims exceeded Pounds 3bn, the Lloyd's insurance market would feel little impact. Because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk - known as the retrocession market - has shrunk considerably in recent years, US insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through Lloyd's. Mr Roger Hill, insurance analyst at Warburg Securities, said he estimated that mainline UK insurers faced no more than Pounds 75m in damage claims so far. 'At the moment we are relaxed about it,' he said. The real question, he added, is the level of reinsurance available to the UK underwriters. Royal Insurance estimated the company's losses at no more than Pounds 20m. Among other UK insurers, Mr Hill estimated that General Accident may face losses of up to Pounds 30m, while Guardian Royal Exchange faced Pounds 5m and Sun Alliance and Commercial Union Pounds 10m each. However, Hurricane Andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the Gulf of Mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards New Orleans, which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage. Scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the Alabama port of Mobile and the Louisiana-Texas border, probably tomorrow night or early Thursday. It could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Shell Oil was evacuating most of the 900 workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution. A substantial part of America's oil refining industry is concentrated on the Gulf coast, in Louisiana and Texas, and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations. Andrew, the first Caribbean hurricane of the season, hit the eastern coast of Florida early yesterday, gusting up to 165mph. It ripped roofs off houses, smashed cars and trucks, snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the Gulf. A million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern Florida as the hurricane moved in from the Bahamas on Sunday. The Florida Power and Light company said that about 1.2m of its customers, or 32 per cent, were without power. Some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of Coral Gables, just south of Miami, where the National Hurricane Center is located. Its radar and satellite antennae were blown away. President Bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state.

            "|US cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Florida to eastern Texas were on alert last night as Hurricane Andrew headed west after hitting southern Alabama leaving at least eight dead, causing severe property damage, and leaving 1.2 million homes without electricity. Gusts of up to 165 mph were recorded. It is the fiercest hurricane to hit the US in decades. As Andrew moved across the Gulf there was concern that it might hit New Orleans, which would be particularly susceptible to flooding, or smash into the concentrated offshore oil facilities. President Bush authorized federal disaster assistance for the affected areas.

            "|US cities along the Gulf of Mexico from Alabama to eastern Texas were on alert last night as Hurricane Bush headed west after hitting southern Florida leaving at least eight dead, causing severe property damage, and leaving 1.2 million homes without electricity. Gusts of up to 165 mph were recorded. It is the fiercest hurricane to hit the US in decades. As Bush moved across the Gulf there was concern that it might hit New Orleans, which would be particularly susceptible to flooding, or smash into the concentrated offshore oil facilities.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. the lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. more than dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. in north miami, damage is minimal. worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across homestead, 25 miles to the south of miami, where a typical house sells for dollars 100,000 to dollars 150,000. us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but lloyd's exposure there is minimal. many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a holiday inn. across florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

country. although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. in louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city, franklin and new iberia. associated tornadoes devastated laplace, 20 miles west of new orleans. then, however, andrew lost force as it moved north over land. by yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas. the storm caused little damage to louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. the lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. more than dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. in north miami, damage is minimal. worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across homestead, 25 miles to the south of miami, where a typical house sells for dollars 100,000 to dollars 150,000. us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but lloyd's exposure there is minimal. many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a holiday inn. across florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. hurricane hugo, which devastated much of south carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some dollars 4.2bn. further uninsured losses may have raised the total to dollars 6bn-dollars 10bn.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

disaster in us history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of new orleans. the storm, which brought havoc to southern florida on monday and then headed north-west across the gulf of mexico, had made landfall late on tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural cajun country. although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. in louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city, franklin and new iberia. associated tornadoes devastated laplace, 20 miles west of new orleans. then, however, andrew lost force as it moved north over land. by yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas. the storm caused little damage to louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. the lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. more than dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. in north miami, damage is minimal. worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across homestead, 25 miles to the south of miami, where a typical house sells for dollars 100,000 to dollars 150,000. us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but lloyd's exposure there is minimal. many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a holiday inn. across florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. hurricane hugo, which devastated much of south carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some dollars 4.2bn. further uninsured losses may have raised the total to dollars 6bn-dollars 10bn.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

            "|HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans. The storm, which brought havoc to southern Florida on Monday and then headed north-west across the Gulf of Mexico, had made landfall late on Tuesday night some 60 miles south-west of the city in the agricultural Cajun country. Although the damage from the hurricane's landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers' losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyd's insurance market said yesterday. In Louisiana, the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about 120 miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as Morgan City, Franklin and New Iberia. Associated tornadoes devastated Laplace, 20 miles west of New Orleans. Then, however, Andrew lost force as it moved north over land. By yesterday afternoon, it had been down-graded to tropical storm, in that its sustained windspeeds were below 75 mph. Initial reports said at least one person had died, 75 been injured and thousands made homeless along the Louisiana coast, after 14 confirmed deaths in Florida and three in the Bahamas. The storm caused little damage to Louisiana's important oil-refining industry, although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut. The Lloyd's member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small. More than Dollars 15bn of damage may have been caused in all, but was mostly to uninsured property, he said. In north Miami, damage is minimal. Worst affected is one hotel, whose basement was flooded. Most of the destruction occurred in a 10-mile band across Homestead, 25 miles to the south of Miami, where a typical house sells for Dollars 100,000 to Dollars 150,000. US insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties, but Lloyd's exposure there is minimal. Many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured, as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area. Only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged, a Holiday Inn. Across Florida, some 2m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn. Further uninsured losses may have raised the total to Dollars 6bn-Dollars 10bn.

            "|\"Mad cow disease\" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. \"I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,\" says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. \"But they certainly are not zero. I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder.\" Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s. The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly. The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans. Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed. In March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100% of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE. \"I think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation,\" said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union. The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. \"In the course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented.\" As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE. The government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and is budgeting $16 million for 1990. Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of Northern Ireland. Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months. David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of \"BSE hysteria\" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is \"remote.\" The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease. A commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, a professor at Oxford University, reported last year that the cause of BSE \"is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses.\" The report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. The Southwood report said it is \"most unlikely\" that the disease poses a threat to humans. But the report added: \"If our assessments of these likelihoods are incorrect, the implications would be extremely serious.\" There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last year. Another form, known as kuru, had been found in cannibals in New Guinea. According to a report in the British Medical Journal, the incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than it is in countries free of scrapie. \"It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of BSE on human health,\" a consultative committee reported to the Agriculture Ministry.

            "|\"Mad cow disease\" has killed 10,000 cattle, restricted the export market for Britain's cattle industry and raised fears about the safety of eating beef. The government insists that the disease poses only a remote risk to human health, but scientists still aren't certain what causes the disease or how it is transmitted. \"I think everyone agrees that the risks are low,\" says Martin Raff, a neurobiologist at University College, London. \"But they certainly are not zero. I have not changed my eating habits, but I certainly do wonder.\" Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, was diagnosed only in 1986. The symptoms are very much like scrapie, a sheep disease which has been in Britain since the 1700s. The incurable disease eats holes in the brains of its victims; in late stages a sick animal may act skittish or stagger drunkenly. The suspicion is that the disease was transmitted through cattle feed, which used to contain sheep by-products as a protein supplement. The government banned the use of sheep offal in cattle feed in June, 1988, and later banned the use of cattle brain, spleen, thymus, intestines and spinal cord in food for humans. Sheep offal is still used in pig and poultry feed. In March, the government announced that it would pay farmers 100% of market value or average market price, whichever is less, for each animal diagnosed with BSE. \"I think it is a recognition -- not just of pressure from farmers -- but that the public would feel more confident that no BSE-infected animal would ever be likely to go anywhere near the food chain if there was 100% compensation,\" said Sir Simon Gourlay, president of the National Farmers Union. The disease struck one of his own cows, Gourlay said. \"In the course of 24 hours, the animal went from being ostensibly quite normal to very vicious and totally disoriented.\" As of Feb. 9, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that 9,998 cattle have been destroyed after being diagnosed with BSE. The government has paid $6.1 million in compensation, and is budgeting $16 million for 1990. Ireland's Department of Agriculture and Food said about 20 cases have been confirmed there, all of them near the border with the British province of Northern Ireland. Because of the disease, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in July banned imports of cattle, embryos and bull semen from Britain, said Margaret Webb, a USDA spokeswoman in Washington. Similar embargoes have been imposed by Australia, Finland, Israel, Sweden, West Germany and New Zealand, according to the Agriculture Ministry, and the European Community has proposed a ban on exports of British cattle older than 6 months. David Maclean, a junior agriculture minister, has complained of \"BSE hysteria\" in the media and has insisted that the risk of the disease passing to humans is \"remote.\" The government has committed $19 million to finding the cause of the disease. A commission chaired by Sir Richard Southwood, a professor at Oxford University, reported last year that the cause of BSE \"is quite unlike any bacteria or known viruses.\" The report said the disease is impossible to detect in apparently healthy animals because it does not prompt the immune system to produce antibodies. The Southwood report said it is \"most unlikely\" that the disease poses a threat to humans. But the report added: \"If our assessments of these likelihoods are incorrect, the implications would be extremely serious.\" There is a human variant of spongiform encephalopathy, known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. About two dozen cases were reported in Britain last year. Another form, known as kuru, had been found in cannibals in New Guinea. According to a report in the British Medical Journal, the incidence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is no higher in Britain than it is in countries free of scrapie. \"It is urgent that the same reassurance can be given about the lack of effect of BSE on human health,\" a consultative committee reported to the Agriculture Ministry.

            "|\"Right now the rains have caused everything to green up, but that can change in a few weeks,\" Lisa Boyd, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection in Sacramento, said Monday. \"The state's really a tinderbox this year. Everyone's going to have to be extra careful.\"; In Santa Clara County, the conditions are not yet extreme; March storms probably delayed fire season until mid-June.; But the county's wild lands are littered with heavy fuel -- brush and trees -- killed by the drought or the December freeze.; \"The late rains have given us a real good grass crop, the catalyst to ignite heavier fuels,\" said fire prevention officer Dick Mauldin at the forestry department's Morgan Hill ranger unit.; Particularly vulnerable are the eucalyptus groves that did not survive the freeze, Mauldin said. \"Fires in there are going to be particularly hot, hard to put out,\" he said.; Statewide, according to the U.S. Forest Service, 10 percent of the trees in the 18 national forests have been killed by the drought or the insect infestations it spawned.; State forestry officials estimate 10 million trees -- Boyd called them \"standing kindling\" -- have died in California's wooded areas since the drought began.; California's worst fire year was 1987, when 900,000 acres burned. Summer weather will be the key to how severe this fire season is.; \"If we get into a period of temperatures in the 90s and 100s and it stays that way for a week or so, there is some real potential for major fires,\" Mauldin said.; Firefighters are most concerned about rural areas of the South Bay and East Bay where people have built homes among heavy vegetation.; \"We preach every year for homeowners to take precautions (such as clearing brush from around their houses), and a lot of people don't do it,\" Mauldin said. \"They think 'it's never going to happen to me,' and when it does they start pointing fingers.\"; Mauldin said the Morgan Hill ranger unit will begin manning some of its seasonal stations Monday, begin hiring summer season firefighters June 3, and have all of the back-country stations opened by July 1.; The Morgan Hill unit covers parts of Santa Clara, Alameda, Contra Costa, Stanislaus, San Joaquin and Merced counties.; In Alameda and Contra Costa counties, officials also are bracing for a long, hot summer. \"We don't want to say this is the worst fire season in X years, but we are gearing up for it,\" said Ned MacKay, spokesman for the East Bay Regional Park District. \"We have to be prepared.\"; Statewide, the biggest fire threat looms in the chaparral-covered coastal mountains south of Santa Barbara, where the moisture content of trees and shrubs is the lowest ever recorded for this time of year, Boyd said.; \"Every year the drought continues, the conditions get more explosive, but we can't say for sure what is going to happen this year,\" Boyd said.; Two of the forestry department's 22 ranger units -- both in Southern California -- are fully staffed for the fire season now, Boyd said, and all are expected to be ready by mid-June.; California doesn't face the fire threat alone.; Officials at the federal Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, which coordinates firefighting efforts throughout the West, said parts of 11 states in the far West, and North Dakota and Minnesota, also face major fire danger this year.; Wildfire precautions; The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection advises residents of rural areas to take special precautions to protect their homes from wildfires this summer:; (box)Clear at least a 30-foot defensible space of brush and dry grass around your house. On some properties, such as those on the ridge tops, the clear area should be as much as 100 feet wide. The break doesn't have to be bare dirt, but could be planted with fire-resistant vegetation.; (box)Remove all pine needles and leaves from your roof, eaves and rain gutters.; (box)Trim tree limbs within 10 feet of your chimney and trim all dead limbs hanging over your house or garage.; (box)Install a spark arrester on your chimney. They are available at hardware stores.; (box)Treat wood shingle roofs with fire retardant on a regular basis.; (box)Make sure there is adequate access for firefighters to get to your home, and ensure that neighborhood streets are clearly identified.; (box)Further information can be obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's fire prevention unit in Morgan Hill, (408) 779-2121.; Source: California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection|Because of a five-year drought and rains that nurtured grass now turning dry, California is gearing up for a dangerous wildfire season.

Dickens , described as 'the king of DIY ' on a profile on the Baumhaus website , could now face a jail sentence or a fine of up to £20,000 . The site says the solid hardwood Nutkin cot , a modified version of which is still being sold , is suitable for children aged 0 to 12 years as it 'transforms easily from cot into stunning sleigh bed . ' It says the cot is 'extremely versatile ' and can be set to three different heights . In 2013 , Baumhaus released a product recall for the original design of the cot , explaining that parts of the bed , particularly the gaps at the top , had been identified as a potential trap-hazard . A notice published online by consumer watchdog Which ? said there is a 'risk of children trapping their head and neck in the gaps at the top . ' It added : ' A child 's legs or arms could become trapped between the end slat of the drop-down side of some products sold . ' The company , which produces a number of ranges of furniture , has since modified the design and it is available from a number of retailers for around £500 .

            "|'Divisive ' : Patients are left in corridors outside wards they should be in while waiting for a free bed . Hospitals are being encouraged to park seriously ill patients on trolleys in corridors to ease the A & E crisis . Doctors say the controversial practice of ‘ boarding ’ – which amounts to letting wards overflow – is already being used at a number of under-pressure hospitals in England . It involves putting patients on trolleys outside the wards they should be in while they wait for a free bed instead of keeping them in A & E . Rather than criticising the measure , desperate A & E doctors say boarding should be used more widely – even though they concede it is ‘ potentially toxic ’ . They argue it is necessary to free up space in overcrowded casualty units . As a result , doctors at the influential Royal College of Emergency Medicine ( RCEM ) have now given boarding their backing . But critics question its safety , amid fears that giving the green light to boarding could serve to legitimise overflowing NHS wards . Dr Adrian Boyle , an A & E consultant at Addenbrooke ’ s Hospital in Cambridge and a prominent RCEM member , argued it was better to have patients waiting on corridor trolleys , after they had been seen and assessed , than languishing outside A & E in queuing ambulances . Between mid-December and mid-January , there were 11,203 occasions across England – more than 350 a day – in which ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because A & Es were full . Casualties are often crammed because patients can not be shifted elsewhere in the hospital due to lack of beds – a situation called ‘ exit block ’ . Studies show that when A & Es are crowded , patients fare worse and death rates can rise . Dr Boyle said : ‘ Boarding spreads the risk across the whole hospital , rather than concentrating and multiplying it in the emergency department. ’ He admitted it was ‘ potentially toxic and divisive ’ but said an ‘ exceptional response ’ was needed to ‘ exceptional circumstances ’ . Dr Boyle said that ‘ a handful ’ of hospitals now use boarding during busy periods , but he would not name them . A spokesman for Addenbrooke ’ s said they did not use the practice . Dr Boyle was speaking at a conference organised by the RCEM , which is advocating greater use of boarding . With hospitals – and A & Es in particular – getting busier every year , he said action had to be taken to better manage the rising flow of patients . ‘ If we get a trend like this going on into next winter , it ’ s going to be like Armageddon , ’ he warned . On 11,203 occasions across England – more than 350 a day – ambulances were forced to wait more than an hour to hand over their patients because A & Es were full . Emergency doctors also see boarding as a way of making their hospital colleagues realise the problems they are facing . Dr Katherine Henderson , an A & E consultant at St Thomas ’ s Hospital in London , said : ‘ It is not acceptable to have people waiting in the emergency department , out of sight of the rest of the hospital. ’ But many medics have serious reservations . Dr Chris Whale , clinical director of Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , said there was ‘ pretty much no evidence ’ that boarding was safe in NHS hospitals .
